# Jade Royale Casino

## Overview

Jade Royale Casino is a 3D online casino platform featuring an immersive 3D casino floor with interactive slot machines and gaming experiences. The application combines a modern React frontend with Three.js 3D rendering and an Express backend with PostgreSQL database storage.

The platform provides user authentication, virtual currency management, slot machine games, and comprehensive player statistics tracking. Users navigate a visually rich 3D casino environment where they can interact with different game stations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for UI components
- Three.js via @react-three/fiber for 3D rendering
- @react-three/drei for 3D utilities and controls
- Vite as build tool and development server
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Minimal Radix UI components (5 primitives: checkbox, dialog, label, slot, visually-hidden)

**State Management:**
- Zustand for client-side state management
- Multiple stores for different concerns:
  - `useUser`: Authentication and user profile state
  - `useAudio`: Audio settings (music/SFX toggles, volume)
  - `useGame`: Game phase management (ready/playing/ended)
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state synchronization

**3D Scene Architecture:**
- Canvas-based 3D rendering using react-three-fiber
- First-person navigation with pointer lock controls
- Room-based scene organization (slots, cashier, fish tables)
- Interactive 3D objects triggering modal dialogs
- GLSL shader support for advanced visual effects

**Component Structure:**
- Modal-based interactions for games and transactions:
  - `AuthModal`: User login/registration with demo mode option
  - `CashierModal`: Deposits, withdrawals, transaction history
  - `SlotMachineModal`: Slot machine gameplay interface
  - `StatsModal`: Player statistics and analytics
  - `UpgradeAccountModal`: Convert demo accounts to permanent accounts
- `CasinoScene`: Main 3D environment renderer
- `Navigation`: Transparent top navigation bar (authenticated users only)
  - Left side: Daily Check-in and Free Credits clickable icons
  - Right side: Credit balance display and user avatar dropdown menu
  - Dropdown menu: Upgrade Account (demo users only), View Stats, Change Password, Logout
- `AudioManager`: Background music and SFX playback
- Custom event system for cross-component communication

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js with Express for HTTP server
- TypeScript with ESM modules
- Express-session for session-based authentication
- bcryptjs for password hashing

**API Design:**
- RESTful endpoints under `/api` prefix
- Session-based authentication (cookies)
- JSON request/response format
- Error handling middleware with status codes

**Key Routes:**
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Create new user account
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate user
- `POST /api/auth/logout`: End user session
- `GET /api/auth/me`: Get current user profile
- `POST /api/auth/demo`: Create instant demo account with 2000 free credits
- `POST /api/auth/upgrade-demo`: Convert demo account to permanent account
- `POST /api/transactions`: Create transaction
- `GET /api/transactions`: Retrieve user transaction history
- `GET /api/stats`: Get player game statistics
- `POST /api/slot-machine/spin`: Execute slot machine game logic

**Data Access Layer:**
- `DatabaseStorage` class implementing `IStorage` interface
- Abstraction layer for database operations
- Transaction management for balance updates
- Game statistics aggregation

### Data Storage

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL via Neon serverless driver
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database access
- WebSocket connection for serverless compatibility

**Schema Design:**
- `users` table: User credentials and balance
  - id (serial primary key)
  - username (unique text)
  - password (hashed text)
  - balance (integer, default 1000)
  - isDemo (boolean, default false)
  - createdAt (timestamp, default now())

- `transactions` table: Financial and game activity log
  - id (serial primary key)
  - userId (foreign key to users)
  - type (text: 'deposit', 'withdraw', 'bet', 'win')
  - amount (integer)
  - balanceBefore (integer)
  - balanceAfter (integer)
  - description (optional text)
  - createdAt (timestamp)

**Data Validation:**
- Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Type inference from Drizzle schemas
- Client and server-side validation

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Flow:**
- Session-based authentication using express-session
- Session stored in memory (configurable for production)
- HTTP-only cookies for session tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10-12 rounds)
- All auth responses include `isDemo` flag for client state management

**Demo Mode:**
- Instant access with "Try Demo Mode" button (no registration required)
- Demo accounts receive 2000 free credits
- Unique usernames generated with timestamp + random suffix
- Retry logic (10 attempts) prevents username collisions
- Demo users can upgrade to permanent accounts anytime
- Upgrade validation: username trimming, character set enforcement (alphanumeric + underscore), length checks (3-20 chars), minimum 6-character passwords
- Bcrypt cost 12 for upgraded accounts

**Session Configuration:**
- 7-day session expiration
- Secure cookies in production
- Custom session secret via environment variable

**Authorization:**
- Middleware checks session for protected routes
- User ID stored in session upon login
- Balance and transaction queries scoped to authenticated user

### External Dependencies

- Neon PostgreSQL serverless database
- Connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable
- WebSocket-based connection pooling

**Third-Party Libraries:**
- Radix UI: Accessible component primitives
- Three.js ecosystem: 3D rendering and controls
- Fontsource: Self-hosted Inter font
